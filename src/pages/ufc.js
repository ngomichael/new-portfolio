  description: `My project does exactly what the names suggests, it displays UFC statistics.
  More specifically, it displays UFC fighter statistics. The home page shows you the top 10
  pound for pound fighters and as a user you pick a fighter. Once you pick a fighter the 
  application takes you to another page where you are able to see 6 different statistics for
  that fighter, where they're from, and their record. 
  In my rankings of my favorite projects, this is definitely up there. I just learned so much at
  the end of the project and had so much fun immersing myself in different technologies.
  The most notable 3 were: React, Redux, and React-Router. This project is what really started my 
  love for React and it has only grown ever since.`,
