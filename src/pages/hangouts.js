  description: `UW Hangouts is a web application that I created with Muatasim Qazi and Yash Vig for
  our server-side web development final project. If you played around with our application you would 
  notice three main features: video chatting, messaging, and searching for friends. With a timeline
  of ~1.5 weeks, I am really happy with how much we were able to get done and that we only had to suffer 
  through one all-nighter (I count that as a win). Thinking back at how much I learned through this class
  and all of the skills I gained and applied, I can say that all of the stressful Monday nights (the
  assignemnts were due on Tuesday) were worth it.`,
